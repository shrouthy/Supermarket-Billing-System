# Supermarket-Billing-System:
A Python-powered supermarket billing system with dynamic pricing, real-time receipts, and multi-customer support — built for practical retail scenarios.
It asks customer details, shows available products, lets you add items with quantities, calculates discounts based on total amount, and prints a formatted bill, exactly like a real-world mini POS system.
This project is a console-based Supermarket Billing System built using Python. It simulates the core functionalities of a billing counter from listing available products to generating a detailed bill with quantity, price, discounts, and final total.

**Project Overview:**
1. Customer details (Name, Phone) are captured at the start.
2. Products are displayed from an internal catalog (with prices).
3. Users can select products, specify quantities, add multiple items.
4. Discounts are automatically applied based on total bill amount.
5. A clear, formatted receipt is generated at the end of the transaction.
6. Supports multiple billing sessions without restarting the program.

**Key Features:**
1. Dynamic Product Selection: Add multiple items with custom quantities from a live catalog.
2. Automatic Discount System: Tiered discounts (5%–25%) based on bill value.
3. Clear Itemized Billing: Organized receipt showing product, quantity, unit price, and total price.
4. Multi-Customer Billing: Process multiple bills without restarting the application.
5. Formatted Console Output: Professional, easy-to-read billing receipts.
6. Built Entirely in Core Python: No external libraries — pure logic and formatting.
